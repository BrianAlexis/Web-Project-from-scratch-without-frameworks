# What is this project?

This project is based on learning how the COMPONENTS of React work. I made a basic page with HTML and CSS (later in the project I will use TailwindCSS) but what I focused most on in the project was understanding how the logic behind the creation of the React COMPONENTS works. This project is made with vanilla JS and with a single dependency called json-server to simulate a JSON API to bring all my data from.


## Project initialization
To initialize the project, just bring it to our computer in the way that is most comfortable for you and once opened, install JSON server dependencies.


```bash
  npm i json-server
```
After that we are going to initializing the API with:
```bash
  npx json-server data/data.json
```
